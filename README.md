# langchain-rag-app
Core Areas to Cover
We'll break the project into 8 major areas:

1. Project Structure & Setup
Why?
To keep things modular, maintainable, and production-ready.

Includes:
Directory layout

Dependency management (requirements.txt)

.env for secrets/configs

2. Document Ingestion Pipeline
Why?
To allow users to upload documents and convert them into vector embeddings.

Includes:
Upload endpoint (FastAPI)

Text extraction (PDF, TXT, DOCX)

Tokenization & chunking (LangChain’s RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)

Embedding generation (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)

3. Vector Store Integration
Why?
To store and retrieve document chunks efficiently.

Includes:
Using ChromaDB or FAISS as a free local vector store

Storing metadata for traceability

Persisting vector store across sessions

4. RAG Query Endpoint
Why?
To let users ask questions and get context-aware answers based on uploaded documents.

Includes:
Query endpoint (FastAPI)

Retrieval from vector store

LLM chain with LangChain (RetrievalQA or ConversationalRetrievalChain)

5. Rate Limiting & Security
Why?
To prevent abuse and support production-readiness.

Includes:
API rate limiting (e.g., slowapi)

CORS policy

Basic Auth / Token Auth (Optional)

6. Logging & Error Handling
Why?
For debugging, observability, and graceful degradation.

Includes:
Logging (file & console)

Exception handlers for FastAPI

Input validation with Pydantic

7. Environment Management
Why?
To isolate development environments and manage sensitive data.

Includes:
.env file for API keys, config

Integration with LangChain’s config system

8. Testing & Extensibility
Why?
To make the system reliable and easy to scale later.

Includes:
Unit & integration tests (using pytest)

Clear interfaces for plugging in new LLMs or vector stores
